A subset of PREVENT-AD participants underwent amyloid (NAV4694), and tau (flortaucipir) PET. The derivatives are composed of SUVR images referenced either to the cerebellum gray matter or the whole cerebellum for amyloid, and to the inferior cerebellum gray matter for tau. We developed an in-house pipeline to automate all the processing steps that are similar to the processing method used by the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) group. The pipeline is freely available, and more information can be found here: https://github.com/villeneuvelab/vlpp. Briefly, frames are realigned and averaged. The PET image is then registered to the native T1-weighted image (time point closest to PET) using ANTs. The T1 image was segmented with the Desikan-Killiany atlas using FreeSurfer version 5.3 (Desikan et al., 2006) using the standard recon-all command. PET images were then masked to remove the scalp and cerebrospinal fluid (obtained from SPM segmentation), to reduce contamination by non-grey and non-white matter voxels. To then generate SUVR images, the PET image was divided by the average tracer uptake value in the reference region. Lastly, images were smoothed with a 6mm Gaussian filter. Note that SUVR images are in participant-specific anatomical space.
