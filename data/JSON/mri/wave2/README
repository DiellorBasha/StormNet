PREVENT-AD Data Release 7.0, 2019-2020 MRI data ("wave 2" MRI data)

For questions please contact the PREVENT-AD Study Coordinator, Jennifer Tremblay-Mercier (jennifer.tremblay-mercier@douglas.mcgill.ca)

This MRI data is part of PREVENT-AD Data Release 7.0, accessible to PREVENT-AD collaborators who agreed to the Data Use Agreement and Publication Policy. This is not a public data release. Please refer to the PREVENT-AD Data Sharing and Publication Policy document for instructions on how to acknowledge use of this data in publications.

This MRI dataset comprises scans acquired between January 2019 and March 2020 on 182 PREVENT-AD participants who previously had a lumbar puncture or a PET scan as part of the study. Scans were acquired at the Brain Imaging Centre of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute on a 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma Fit scanner with a 32-channel head coil, subsequent to a scanner system upgrade in November 2018. Note that the sequences also differ from those acquired in the study previously.

Due to the scanner upgrade, we have not currently combined this data with our older MRI data. This data belongs to "wave 2" of PREVENT-AD MRI data, whereas "wave 1" was acquired from 2011 to 2017.

The scans are associated with a particular PREVENT-AD study visit that differs across participants. The data is therefore organized using 6 different session labels (ses-FU24, ses-FU36, ses-FU48, ses-FU60, ses-FU72, ses-FU84).

The following MRI images are included. The location of related files is given, relative to each participant's session sub-directory.

Please note that while all participants were cognitively normal at enrollment, participants' cognitive performance may be the range of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at study visits included in this dataset. These timepoints can be determined from the tabular data of the Data Release (variable "possible_MCI_visit" in Demographics table).

Known Issues:

There are few cases of missing data when the scanning session was cut short, but there are no missing T1w, T2w, or fMRI images. There are two T2w images with a different resolution. There are also a few cases of parameter inconsistencies and missing images among the phase-encoding polarity pairs acquired for distortion correction of the resting-state functional MRI. For a list of missing and inconsistent data, please see the included BIDS Validator output.

Most scans were completed in one session. In two cases, the participant left and returned to the scanner; this is not indicated by separate sessions in this dataset. In these two cases, the images acquired in the second session included FLAIR, MP2RAGE and T1 maps. All other images in this dataset were acquired during the same session. If this may impact your study, please contact the Study Coordinator for more information.

Please report any other issues to the Study Coordinator so that we can improve this dataset.
